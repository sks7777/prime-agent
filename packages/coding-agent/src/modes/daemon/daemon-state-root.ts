/**
 * Predicate for "this daemon belongs to our state root". A daemon is ours when
 * its socket sits in our socket dir, when it sits anywhere inside our agent dir,
 * or when the supervisor ownership registry (itself scoped to our HOME) records
 * it under our agent dir — the last two rules keep daemons on custom
 * `--daemon-socket` paths in scope for the root that started them.
 *
 * The agent-dir rule is what keeps *hidden* supervisors reachable. A supervisor
 * that has handed its runtime to a successor is no longer the registered owner,
 * so the registry cannot name it; the OS socket sweep is the only thing that can
 * still see it. Scoping by the registry alone would silently put those daemons
 * out of reach of `daemon ps` and `shutdown --force` and leak them forever, which
 * is the regression ENG-4603 covers. A socket inside our agent dir is
 * unambiguously ours — another HOME resolves to another agent dir — so honouring
 * it restores that reach without widening scope back to the whole machine.
 *
 * The registry read is deferred and memoised so the common case (every socket in
 * our own socket dir) costs nothing, and a fresh matcher per sweep keeps results
 * current for callers that poll.
 *
 * The socket dir is deliberately part of the root: it is per-uid, per-TMPDIR
 * state, so two invocations that share TMPDIR also share that one daemon
 * namespace no matter which HOME or agent dir they run under — they could not
 * run concurrent default daemons on one socket path anyway. Scoping the dir away
 * would orphan every unregistered listener there (workers, abandoned and
 * pre-registry daemons), which `shutdown --force` must still reap.
