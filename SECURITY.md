# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not report security vulnerabilities through public Issues, Discussions, or pull requests.

Send the report to [security@primeintellect.ai](mailto:security@primeintellect.ai). For encrypted communication and the current company-wide disclosure policy, see [primeintellect.ai/security](https://www.primeintellect.ai/security).

Include the following when possible:

- The affected version or commit
- The affected component and environment
- Reproduction steps or a minimal proof of concept
- The expected and observed impact
- Any known mitigations

Do not include real API keys, tokens, personal data, or credentials in the report. Use redacted or disposable test values.

## Behavioral release evaluation

The `pre-release` label enables a trusted behavioral evaluation before release. Exact base
and head revisions build only inside isolated Prime sandboxes. GitHub runners treat their
packages as opaque bytes and never execute or extract them. Model and sandbox credentials
stay behind trusted Verifiers interception and are removed from candidate process
environments. Separate durable approval and evaluation statuses prevent an in-flight evaluation
from restoring approval after the label is removed. Both statuses are revoked when either candidate
revision changes, and repository rules must require both with strict up-to-date enforcement. See
[`scripts/evals/short_swe/README.md`](scripts/evals/short_swe/README.md)
for the full boundary.

## What to Expect

Maintainers will assess the report, determine its scope, and coordinate remediation and disclosure when appropriate. Please allow time for investigation before publishing details that could put users at risk.

Security fixes are generally prepared against the default branch and released on a schedule chosen by the maintainers. We do not guarantee fixes for older versions.

For ordinary bugs, feature requests, and support questions, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent/discussions).
